lights in guest rooms rigged to rfid based on if the current room is vacant 

if the current room is vacant the lights in the room are auto off based on the RFID registration key of the guest checking out,

janitoral can swipe RFID to access lights and when janitoral leaves the lights are auto off (when the room is marked as a vacant room)

when guest checks into room and keypass is assigned RFID triggers the room's lights to function,



to save wasted electricity via hotel's motel's from absent mindedness
